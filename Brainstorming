brainstorming:
teachers register as teachers
accounts and passwords, secure system
different priorities for notifications
links to classes
teacher to student, counselor to student
counselors can chat through system
search for messages w/ keywords or priorities
possibly log into specific classes? w/ counselors log in as student
high priority messages on homepage or messages with all without logging in
priority affects order messages listed in? in broad, viewing all
way to view all and way to view only one class/admin/priority
block bad words? (not high priority as mostly teacher userbase)
code for classes/groups similar to discord
sidebar with class links on left similar to discord
text box at bottom std
profile circle, icon school picture? top right
separate messages because mostly teachers will be using
like/dislike for voting

like discord for school, similar to canvas
any organization sends messages
webpage
eventually maybe app if we can, would be more convenient
